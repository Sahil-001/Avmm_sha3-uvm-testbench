The DUT has been [cloned from the cryptech.is project site] (https://git.cryptech.is/core/hash/sha3.git).

[tiny_sha3](https://github.com/mjosaarinen/tiny_sha3.git) implementation is used as a reference model to check the RTL DUT for any functional discrepancy that might exist in the RTL implementation.

An Avalon MM lite wrapper is created around the DUT.
